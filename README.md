# World-Happiness-Report
I am using excel for cleaning null value.
I am just using the past ten years for date and using tableau for data visualization.
In this data set, i am looking happiness ladder based on six aspect: Log GDP per-capita, Social Support, Freedom for Life Change, Healthy Life Expectacy, Perception of Corruption, and Generosity. I also make a ranking between positif and negative affect.
